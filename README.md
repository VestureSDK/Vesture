## Build fast; Run faster

**Vesture** is a flexible and extensible C# framework designed to accelerate enterprise application development by allowing developers to focus purely on business logic. It provides a robust, enterprise-grade shell and a curated set of architectural patterns that can be easily extended and adapted to meet evolving requirements.

Built with **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation compliance in mind**, Vesture ensures that applications can fully leverage native-like performance, faster startup times, and reduced memory footprint—making it an ideal foundation for modern, high-performance .NET applications.

Whether you're building greenfield solutions or modernizing existing systems, Vesture offers a future-ready platform grounded in consistency, maintainability, and performance.

## Work in Progress

Vesture is **currently under active development** and evolving rapidly. While it already provides a solid foundation with an AOT-compliant Mediator implementation, it is still considered an **early-stage framework**.

We're just getting started. Upcoming features will expand the framework’s capabilities to cover a broader range of architectural concerns—bringing more patterns, utilities, and enterprise-ready components designed with performance, extensibility, and AOT support at the core.
