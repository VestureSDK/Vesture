The namespace <xref:Vesture.Mediator.DependencyInjection> provides integration components 
for configuring and managing dependency injection for the mediator pattern. It includes 
utilities and extensions that allow developers to register handlers, middlewares, and other 
mediator-related services in an Inversion of Control container.

This namespace simplifies the setup and management of the mediator and its dependencies, 
enabling seamless service resolution and promoting loose coupling in application architecture.
