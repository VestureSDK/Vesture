The namespace <xref:Ingot.Mediator.Engine> includes low-level abstractions and implementation details that power 
the mediator pattern's advanced operations, including the construction and management of invocation pipelines. 
It provides the building blocks that enable the mediator to efficiently route requests, commands, and events 
through handlers and middlewares.
