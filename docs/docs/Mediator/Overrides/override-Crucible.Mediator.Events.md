The namespace <xref:Crucible.Mediator.Events> includes classes and interfaces
to handle the mediator event use case with <xref:Crucible.Mediator.Events.IEvent> 
as contract and <xref:Crucible.Mediator.Events.EventHandler`1> as handler.

Events represent occurrences or actions that have already taken place, 
and they typically notify other parts of the system to react. 
For instance, events may be used to trigger notifications, logging, 
or other system-wide changes.
